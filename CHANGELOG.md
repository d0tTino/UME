## [0.4.0-dev] - 2023-10-27 

### Added

-   **File-Based Persistence:**
    -   **Configuration (`src/ume/config.py`):** Introduced default snapshot paths for CLI (`~/.ume/ume_graph.json`) and API (`ume_graph.json` in CWD, overrideable by `UME_SNAPSHOT_PATH` env var). Exported these paths from `ume` package.
    -   **Snapshot Functions (`src/ume/snapshot.py`):**
        -   `snapshot_graph_to_file()`: Enhanced to ensure parent directory for the snapshot file is created before writing. Refined error handling to use `SnapshotError`.
        -   `load_graph_from_file()`: Refined error handling to consistently use `SnapshotError` (e.g., for file not found, parse errors, structural issues). Added validation to ensure nodes referenced in loaded edges exist in the snapshot's nodes data.
    -   **CLI (`ume_cli.py`):**
        -   Implements auto-loading of graph state from `CLI_SNAPSHOT_PATH` on startup.
        -   Implements auto-saving of graph state to `CLI_SNAPSHOT_PATH` on normal exit (`exit`, `quit`, `EOF`) and on `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C).
        -   Snapshot commands (`snapshot_save`, `snapshot_load`) now default to `CLI_SNAPSHOT_PATH` if no path is given.
        -   Events generated by CLI now include `source: "cli"`.
    -   **REST API (`app.py`):**
        -   Implements auto-loading of graph state from `API_SNAPSHOT_PATH` on server startup using FastAPI's `@app.on_event("startup")`.
        -   Implements auto-saving of graph state to `API_SNAPSHOT_PATH` on graceful server shutdown using FastAPI's `@app.on_event("shutdown")`.
        -   Added checks in API endpoints to ensure graph is initialized before use.
-   **Testing:**
    -   **CLI Smoke Tests (`tests/test_cli_smoke.py`):** Added tests for CLI persistence, using `monkeypatch` to redirect `HOME` and verify auto-load/save cycles and interaction with manual snapshot load.
    -   **API Tests (`tests/test_api.py`):** Added an `autouse` fixture (`isolate_api_snapshot`) to `monkeypatch` `ume.config.API_SNAPSHOT_PATH` to a temporary file for each test, ensuring test isolation for API persistence features. Existing snapshot tests now use this isolated path.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   `README.md`: Updated "Command-Line Interface" and "REST API" sections to document the new auto-load/save persistence behaviors and default snapshot paths.

## [0.3.1-dev] - 2023-10-27 

### Added

-   **REST API (`app.py`):**
    -   Implemented a FastAPI-based REST API application (`app.py`) in the project root.
    -   Provides HTTP endpoints for interacting with the UME graph:
        -   `POST /event`: Submit events (CREATE_NODE, UPDATE_NODE_ATTRIBUTES, CREATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE).
        -   `GET /nodes`: List all node IDs.
        -   `GET /edges`: List all edges.
        -   `GET /neighbors/{node_id}`: Get neighbors of a node, with optional label filtering.
        -   `POST /snapshot/save`: Save graph state to a JSON file.
        *   `POST /snapshot/load`: Load graph state from a JSON file, replacing the in-memory graph.
        *   `POST /clear`: Clear all nodes and edges from the graph.
    -   Uses an in-memory `MockGraph` instance shared across requests.
    -   Includes error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error details.
-   **API Request Validation:**
    -   Added Pydantic models (`EventInput`, `SnapshotPath`) in `app.py` for automatic request validation and data parsing for the API endpoints.
-   **API Tests (`tests/test_api.py`):**
    *   Created a new test suite for the REST API using FastAPI's `TestClient`.
    *   Includes tests for all endpoints, covering successful operations, error conditions, and graph state changes.
    *   Uses a pytest fixture to ensure a clean graph state for each API test.
-   **Containerization (`Dockerfile`):**
    *   Added a `Dockerfile` to build a container image for the UME REST API.
    *   Configured for Python 3.12, Poetry-based dependency installation (production dependencies only), and Uvicorn for serving the application.
-   **Dependencies:**
    -   Added `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]` to main project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   `README.md`: Added a new "REST API (v0.3.1-dev)" section detailing how to run the API server, access interactive documentation (Swagger UI/Redoc), and use all available endpoints with request/response examples.

## [0.2.0-dev] - 2023-10-27 

### Added

-   **Event-Driven Edge Management:**
    -   `Event` dataclass (`src/ume/event.py`): Extended to support edge operations by making `node_id` optional and adding optional `target_node_id` and `label` fields.
    -   `parse_event()`: Updated to validate new event types "CREATE_EDGE" and "DELETE_EDGE", ensuring required fields (`node_id` as source, `target_node_id`, `label`) are present and correctly typed.
    -   `IGraphAdapter` (`src/ume/graph_adapter.py`): Added `delete_edge()` abstract method.
    -   `MockGraph` (`src/ume/graph.py`): Implemented `delete_edge()` method.
    -   `apply_event_to_graph()` (`src/ume/processing.py`): Extended to handle "CREATE_EDGE" and "DELETE_EDGE" events, calling the appropriate `IGraphAdapter` methods (`add_edge`, `delete_edge`).
-   **Testing:**
    -   Added unit tests in `tests/test_event.py` for parsing "CREATE_EDGE" and "DELETE_EDGE" event types, including valid and invalid cases.
    -   Added unit tests in `tests/test_processing.py` for `apply_event_to_graph` processing of "CREATE_EDGE" and "DELETE_EDGE" events (success and error propagation from adapter).
    -   Added unit tests in `tests/test_graph.py` for `MockGraph.delete_edge()` method (success and error cases).
-   **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md`:
        *   "Event Schema" section updated with JSON examples and descriptions for "CREATE_EDGE" and "DELETE_EDGE" events.
        *   "Basic Usage" section refactored to demonstrate an event-centric approach for creating nodes and edges via `apply_event_to_graph(parse_event(...))`. Query and dump examples updated to reflect edge presence.

### Changed

-   The `node_id` field in the `Event` dataclass is now `Optional[str]` (was `str`), with `parse_event` enforcing its presence for specific event types.
-   `apply_event_to_graph()` now includes defensive checks for string types of IDs and labels for new edge events before calling adapter methods.

### Fixed

-   *(No specific bug fixes noted for this version yet, primarily new features)*

## [0.1.0-dev] - 2023-10-27 

### Added

-   **Core Event Handling:**
    -   `Event` dataclass for structured event representation (`src/ume/event.py`).
    -   `parse_event` function for validating and parsing raw event data into `Event` objects.
    -   `EventError` custom exception for event parsing issues.
-   **Graph Abstraction Layer:**
    -   `IGraphAdapter` interface defining standard graph operations (`src/ume/graph_adapter.py`), including query methods (`get_all_node_ids()`, `find_connected_nodes()`) and new edge management methods (`add_edge()`, `get_all_edges()`).
    -   `MockGraph` implementation of `IGraphAdapter` for in-memory graph representation and testing (`src/ume/graph.py`). Includes methods for node manipulation, queries, and new implementations for `add_edge()` and `get_all_edges()`.
-   **Event Processing Logic:**
    -   `apply_event_to_graph` function to apply parsed `Event` objects to an `IGraphAdapter` instance (`src/ume/processing.py`).
    -   Initial support for `CREATE_NODE` and `UPDATE_NODE_ATTRIBUTES` event types.
    *   `ProcessingError` custom exception for event application issues.
-   **Snapshotting:**
    -   `MockGraph.dump()` method to export graph state (nodes only currently).
    -   `snapshot_graph_to_file` function to save graph dump to a JSON file (`src/ume/snapshot.py`).
    -   `load_graph_from_file` function to restore graph state from a JSON snapshot (`src/ume/snapshot.py`).
    -   `SnapshotError` custom exception for snapshot loading issues.
-   **Testing Framework:**
    -   Setup `pytest` and `pytest-cov` for unit testing and coverage.
    -   Comprehensive unit tests for:
        -   Event parsing (`tests/test_event.py`).
        -   `MockGraph` implementation of `IGraphAdapter` (`tests/test_graph.py`), including new query and edge methods (`add_edge`, `get_all_edges`, updated `find_connected_nodes`, `clear`).
        -   Event processing logic (`tests/test_processing.py`).
        -   Graph serialization and snapshotting (`tests/test_graph_serialization.py`), including `load_graph_from_file` tests and handling of edges in snapshots.
-   **CI Workflow:**
    -   GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated testing, linting (Ruff), formatting checks (Ruff), and coverage reporting on pushes/PRs to main.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Comprehensive `README.md`: Updated "UME Graph Model" and "Basic Usage" sections to reflect edge support, including examples for `add_edge`, `find_connected_nodes` with edges, and snapshot examples showing edge data.
    -   Detailed docstrings for all core modules, public classes, and functions (reviewed and updated).
    -   `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide.
-   **Project Setup:**
    -   `pyproject.toml` configured for Poetry, with dependencies (e.g., `confluent-kafka`) and dev dependencies (e.g., `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`).
    -   Demo scripts (`producer_demo.py`, `consumer_demo.py`) for basic Kafka interaction (though full execution was limited by environment).

### Changed

-   Refactored `MockGraph` to strictly implement `IGraphAdapter` (distinct `add_node` and `update_node` methods).
-   Refactored `apply_event_to_graph` to operate on the `IGraphAdapter` interface, decoupling it from `MockGraph`.
-   Improved validation logic in `apply_event_to_graph` for event payloads.
-   Consolidated and parametrized unit tests for better maintainability.
-   **`MockGraph` Updates for Edge Support:**
    -   `find_connected_nodes()` method now uses the internal edge list to find actual connections.
    -   `dump()` method now includes an "edges" list in its output.
    -   `clear()` method now also clears stored edges.
-   **Snapshotting (`src/ume/snapshot.py`):**
    -   `load_graph_from_file()` function updated to load and validate edge data from snapshots if present.

### Known Issues / Limitations (as of this version)

-   Full end-to-end testing of demo scripts involving Kafka/Redpanda was blocked by environmental issues preventing `confluent-kafka` installation in the test execution environment. Unit tests for core logic are passing.
-   `MockGraph` now includes basic support for directed, labeled edges (storage, retrieval, and inclusion in snapshots). Advanced edge querying or property support is future work.
-   Graph persistence is limited to manual snapshotting of `MockGraph` to a file; no automated persistence or database backend yet.
