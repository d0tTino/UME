# UME Graph Model (Planned)

The Universal Memory Engine (UME) is designed to build and utilize a knowledge graph based on ingested events. This document will detail the schema and structure of that graph, including:

*   **Node Types:** The different kinds of entities that will be represented as nodes in the graph (e.g., users, sessions, concepts, external data points).
*   **Relationship Types:** The types of connections or edges that can exist between nodes (e.g., `HAS_SESSION`, `MENTIONED_CONCEPT`, `RELATED_TO`).
*   **Properties:** The attributes associated with nodes and relationships.
*   **Labels:** How nodes and relationships are categorized or labeled for efficient querying and reasoning.

This section is currently a placeholder. As the UME system's graph processing capabilities are implemented and refined, this document will be updated with the concrete details of the graph model.

The goal is to create a flexible yet structured graph that can provide rich, context-aware memory for AI agents and automations.
