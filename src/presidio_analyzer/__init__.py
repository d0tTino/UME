    It performs basic detection of a handful of PII types so tests which rely
    on automatic redaction have something to work with. Only ``email``,
    ``phone`` and ``ssn`` keys are recognised and the returned ``start`` and
    ``end`` offsets are not exact â€“ tests simply check that a result is
    returned, not the offsets themselves.
